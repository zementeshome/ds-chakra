Design System Starter Kit based on [chakra](https://chakra-ui.com/). It configures Chakra with sensible defaults, makes it ready for your extensions where needed and lays a foundation for your future documentation.

### Design Tokens

Takes the design tokens as in [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/theming/theme) as well as advanced ones:

- Typography
- Colors
- Spacing
- Sizes
- Shadows
- Border & Radius
- Z-indexes

and make them automatically documented and visually discoverable.

### Backlight Documentation

We created [DS Mastery](https://backlight.dev/mastery/) to help you become a hero in the design system development.

To learn about Backlight features there is an [official documentation](https://backlight.dev/docs/) too.
